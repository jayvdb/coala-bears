coala-bears 0.9.0
=================

This release, we had 40 different contributors, pushing almost 200 commits.

To get a quick overview over the current state of all bears, check out
https://coala.io/languages. We added a number of asciinemas so you can see
them in action right away.

Here are the important changes and additions, of course coala was upgraded to
0.9 so you can enjoy all it's new features and bugfixes:

**New Bears:**

Language Independent:

- `QuotesBear` - Checks and corrects your quoting style for any language!
- `SpellCheckBear` - Checks for english spelling mistakes in any source code.

Python:

- `MypyBear` - Checks Python code for typing using Mypy!
- `BanditBear` - Checks Python code for security issues.
- `PEP8NotebookBear` - Autocorrects formatting for Python code in Jupyter
  Notebooks.
- `PySafetyBear` - Checks for known security vulnerabilities of your Python
  requirements.
- `PinRequirementsBear` - Checks if Python requirements are pinned precisely.
- `PycodestyleBear` - Checks Python coding style with better error messages
  and reliability than `PEP8Bear`, however without automatic correction.

Others:

- `PHPCodeSnifferBear` - Ensures that your PHP, JavaScript or CSS code remains
  clean and consistent.
- `Jinja2Bear` - Detects and fixes formatting issues in Jinja2 templates.
- `RSTcheckBear` - Checks reStructuredText for formatting and syntax.
- `PuppetLintBear` - Checks and autocorrects puppet configuration files.
- `CSVLintBear` - Checks syntax of CSV files.

**Bears with New Settings:**

You can look up the new settings at https://coala.io/languages.

- `InvalidLinkBear`
- `GitCommitBear`
- `YapfBear`
- `SCSSLintBear`

**Deleted Settings:**

- `CSecurityBear` does not accept a `neverignore` setting anymore. Those kinds
  of issues are and should be consistently handled by coala.

**Deprecated Settings:**

- The `ignore_regex` setting from `InvalidLinkBear` was deprecated in favour of
  `link_ignore_regex` for more clarity in coafiles.
- `KeywordBear` accepts only one `keywords` argument. The `ci_keywords` and
  `cs_keywords` arguments have been deprecated.
- `JSHintBear` provides an `es_version` argument that implies the
  `use_es6_syntax` argument. The latter has been deprecated in favour of the
  former.
- `JSHintBear` provides a more flexible `javascript_strictness` argument
  instead of the `allow_global_strict` which has been deprecated.
- `RuboCopBear` uses `naming_convention` instead of `name_case` now.

**Other Bear Enhancements:**

- The `coala-bears` package does no longer require Java upon installation.
- `VultureBear` picks up global dependencies.
- `ESLintBear` shows errors as `WARNING` in coala. This simplifies debugging
  bad ESLint configurations.
- `KeywordBear` can now automatically remove TODO comments for any language
  coala has `Language` definitions for.
- `FilenameBear` supports the `spacecase` convention.
- `KeywordBear` checks for `todo` and `fixme` by default.
- `GitCommitBear` has improved result messages.
- `YAMLLintBear` does not check for `document-start` by default. This was not
  a commonly chosen setting.
- `YapfBear` will pass files in-memory to save precious IO time.

**Major API Changes:**

- The bears testing modules were moved to the coalib and are deprecated.

**Bug Fixes:**

- `AnnotationBear` yields a `HiddenResult` with an error message instead of
  raising an exception, when the desired language is not available.
- `AnnotationBear` yields correct results for escaped strings.
  (https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/993)
- `AnnotationBear` yields correct results for rare corner cases of multiline
  strings. (https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/1006)
- An issue where `LatexLintBear` crashed has been resolved.
  (https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/317)
- `InvalidLinkBear` parses links within backticks properly. It also ignores
  links with placeholders like `%s` and others.
- `InvalidLinkBear` ignores FTP links.
  (https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/906)
- `DartLintBear` emits an error when it cannot satisfy given settings.
  (https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/897)
- `CheckstyleBear` emits an error when it cannot satisfy given settings.
  (https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/898)
- `CheckstyleBear`: preset configurations `google` and `sun` are no longer
  downloaded. (https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/1034)
- `YAMLLintBear` picks up the configuration properly.
  (https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/979)
- `JavaPMDBear` works correctly on Mac now.
  (https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/998)
- The dependencies of the following bears were bumped due to upstream
  bugfixes:

    - `AlexBear`
    - `CPPCleanBear`
    - `ESLintBear`
    - `MarkdownBear`
    - `ProseLintBear`
    - `YapfBear`

**Internal Changes:**

  errors using ``happiness``.

  whole list `here <http://dpaste.com/3EP5GCV>`_.

**New Features**

  bears. With this tool, bears are uploaded as individual packages to PyPI
  and just the necessary bears (and their dependencies) can be installed.

  the ``REQUIREMENTS`` attribute. This is one of the requirement objects
  supporting various package managers such as ``apt-get``, ``dnf``,
  ``yum``, ``pip``, ``npm``, ``gem``, and so on. To learn more, please
  see the ``coala`` `0.8.0 release changelog <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.rst>`__.

  an URL to an asciinema video displaying the bear's working.

  and user-friendliness.
